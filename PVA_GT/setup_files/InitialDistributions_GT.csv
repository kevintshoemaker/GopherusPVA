gamma,param,dispersal,uniform,none,,0,0.01,,,Y,Based on Folt
HS,param,hs.mn,normal,c01,,0.66,0.97,0.81,0.08,Y,"Updated from Folt to include our data, Rostal/Jones 2002, and removed translocated pops (uniform is +/- 2SD)"
MA,param,ma.intercept.mn,normal,none,,,,43.52,0,Y,Reran the lm in Folt code to get the variance-covariance matrix (Folt did not include uncertainty on the intercept).  Used LM with constraint from 10-20years old.  But decided that couldn't include the uncertainty because of description in next line.
MA,param,ma.tempeff.mn,normal,none,,,,-1.41,0,Y,"Direct from Folt; Effect of mean annual temperature in units of degrees C  **Decided to make this deterministic because if used variance from Folt, climate signal would be lost completely, and we know that's not how maturity age works"
NS,param,nestsucc,uniform,,,0.15,0.55,,,Y,Changed to uniform (+/- 2SD) from normal because only based on 1 study
PF,param,propfemale.mn,normal,c01,,,,0.5,0.05,Y,"(Assumes 50:50 sex ratio in present day, may want to update with actual adult sex ratios as vary by latitude)"
PF,ancillary,t.mean.ref,fixed,,29,,,,,Y,Temperature at which there is 50:50 sex ratio (baseline for change calculation)
PF,ancillary,p.mean.ref,fixed,,5.38,,,,,Y,Precipitation at which there is 50:50 sex ratio (baseline for change calculation)
PHI_A,param,adultsurv.mn,normal,c01,,0.92,1,0.96,0.03,Y,Based on Folt (MAKE UPPER LIMIT OF 0.995?)
PHI_A,param,phi.a.burneff.mn,normal,none,,,,-0.027,0.003,Y,Effect of years-since-burn on adult survival (also apply to juvenile and hatchling survival?)
PHI_H,param,hatchsurv,uniform,c01,,0,0.4,0.13,0.05,Y,"Uniform is +/- 1 SD instead of 2 because of hitting against bound of zero.  SD is from Folt script. 1/19/23 changed uniform from 0 - 0.29 to 0.04 - 0.4, as this is the range from Perez-Heydrich 2012"
PHI_J,param,juvsurv,uniform,c01,,0.63,0.91,0.77,0.07,Y,Updated from Folt to first average the 6 Conecuh estimates together (uniform is +/- 2SD)
PHI_J,param,phi.j.burneff.mn,normal,none,,,,-0.027,0.003,Y,NEED TO IMPLEMENT IN MODEL for scenario with juvenile burn effect
PR,ancillary,aprmaytmax.mn,fixed,,28.01,,,,,Y,April-May Tmax mean and sd for centering of PR tmax covariate (covariate had mean subtracted and divided by sd)
PR,ancillary,aprmaytmax.sd,fixed,,1.12,,,,,Y,
PR,ancillary,bodysize.mn,fixed,,29.65,,,,,N,Ft. Stewart body size parameters used for centering (covariate had mean subtracted and divided by sd)

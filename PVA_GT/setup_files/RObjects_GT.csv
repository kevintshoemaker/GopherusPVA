HS,HS_clim_eff,Function,,clim.hatch.term,Y,"clim.hatch.term produces a multiplier that HS should be multiplied by to reduce HS as climate warms. June-July mean temperature for predicting nest temperature (unit of degree C).  Precip effect on nest temperature - daily mean precip during incubation period (June-July, unit of mm).
